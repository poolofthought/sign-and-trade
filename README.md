All portions of this project are licensed under the AGPL-3.0 license. You can read all about it at the following location: https://opensource.org/licenses/AGPL-3.0

# Notes relating to License and Copyright
These notes will go away. There here to help me create the repo layout.
All files, unless explicitly stated otherwise are licended under the AGPL-3.0 license. https://softwarefreedom.org/resources/2012/ManagingCopyrightInformation.html

License and Author (for Copyright) information will be in centralized location rather than file by file. However, each file in the repo should contain a reference and link to the central locations of both the license and copyright info.

Example top of file:
// This file is licensed to you under the AGPL-3.0 license. See the LICENSE file in the project root for more information.
// This file is copyrighted. See copyright file in the project root for more information.

The hope is that this scheme of marking licenses and copyrights will mimimize the noise in each source file while at the same time ensuring that the default licensing for any file is the AGPL-3.0.

# Reporting Security Issues and Security Bugs
These types of issues should be reported privately and you should receive a response within 48 hours. You should be able to raise an issue without much detail mentioning that there is a security issue. I will get the notification and reach out for further details.

# Contributing
There are many ways to contribute to this project - writing code will not be the only way. Translations, documentation, and many other ways will be available as well. A document will be prepared detailing how to go about contributing in the next week.
